# mosaic
Mosaic is a personal project to design and implement a lightweight 2D engine in C++ from the ground up. It provides core systems for rendering, input, scripting, and map handling with pixel-art graphics. The focus is on building a foundation flexible enough to support JRPG, dungeon crawler, or tactics-style mechanics in the future.
